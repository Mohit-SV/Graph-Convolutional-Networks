        "\n",
        "You can also avoid using Colab entirely, and download the notebook to run it on your own machine. If you choose this, go to *File* and select *Download .ipynb*.\n",
        "\n",
        "The advantage of using Colab is that you can use a GPU. You can complete this assignment with a CPU, but it will take a bit longer. Furthermore, we encourage you to train using the GPU not only for faster training, but also to get experience with this setting. This includes moving models and tensors to the GPU and back. This experience is vary valuable because for many interesting models and large datasets (like large CNNs for ImageNet, or Transformer models trained on Wikipedia), training on GPU is the only feasible way.\n",
        "\n",
        "The default Colab runtime does not have a GPU. To change this, go to *Runtime - Change runtime type*, and select *GPU* as the hardware accelerator. The GPU that you get changes according to what resources are available at the time, and its memory can go from a 5GB, to around 18GB if you are lucky. If you are curious, you can run the following in a code cell to check:\n",

        "```sh\n",
        "!nvidia-smi\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "Note that despite the name, Google Colab does  not support collaborative work without issues. When two or more people edit the notebook concurrently, only one version will be saved. You can choose to do group programming with one person sharing the screen with the others, or make multiple copies of the notebook to work concurrently.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Submission:** Upload your notebook in .ipynb format to Canvas. The code and answers to the questions in the notebook are sufficient, no separate report is expected. "

        "We report a final test accuracy of 72.3% and final validation accuracy of 83.4%. We observe that the training loss decreases rapidly initially but as training progresses, the training loss plateaus indicating that the model might be stuck in a local minima. We performed an experiment by only decreasing the learning rate to 0.5e-3 and observed a better loss curve which suggests that the model might converge to a better solution. \n",
        "\n",
        "Another intresting observation is that there is a big difference (9%) in the test and validation accuracy with validation accuracy being higher. A probable explanation for this is that the random split generated from the seed assigns more difficult samples to the test set. We confirm our hypothesis by running an experimnet using different seeds to split the dataset. This resulted in a lower difference (2%) between the final test and validation accuracy. In order to get a better indicator of both test and validation accuracy, we could run k-fold cross validation and take the average of final models.  \n",

It also comes with custom code that takes care of aspects that you dealt with manually for this assignment, like a more efficient implementation of the adjacency matrix multiplication via message-passing methods, and Data Loaders that relieve you from having to build block diagonal sparse matrices.\n",
